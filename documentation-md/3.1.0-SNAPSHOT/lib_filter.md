# filter

Essential functions for content filtering.

# Filter Function Library

The filter library provides essential functions for content transformation in access control policies.
These functions enable data redaction, replacement, and removal to implement fine-grained authorization
where different users see different versions of the same resource based on their privileges.

## Core Functions

- **blacken**: Partially or fully redact text while optionally preserving visible portions
- **replace**: Substitute values with alternatives
- **remove**: Delete data elements entirely

## Access Control Applications

### Information Disclosure Control

Access control often requires disclosing partial information rather than all-or-nothing access.
The blacken function supports multiple strategies for controlled disclosure:

**Full Redaction**: Hide all content

Using filter operator:
```sapl
policy "redact_ssn_full"
permit action.id == "view_user_profile"
where
    subject.role == "employee";
transform
    resource.ssn |- filter.blacken
// "123-45-6789" becomes "XXXXXXXXXXX"
```

Using direct function call:
```sapl
policy "redact_ssn_in_list"
permit action == "list_employees"
where
    subject.role == "hr_assistant";
transform
    resource |- {
        @..ssn : filter.blacken
    }
```

**Partial Disclosure - Prefix**: Show identifying prefix, hide remainder

```sapl
policy "show_account_prefix"
permit action.id == "view_transaction"
where
    subject.role == "auditor";
transform
    resource.accountNumber |- filter.blacken(4, 0, "X")
// "9876543210" becomes "9876XXXXXX"
// Useful for: account numbers, transaction IDs, reference codes
```

Direct call with object template:
```sapl
policy "audit_report_with_masked_accounts"
permit action.id == "generate_audit_report"
where
    subject.department == "internal_audit";
transform
    { "accountNumber" : filter.blacken(resource.accountNumber, 4, 0) }
```

**Partial Disclosure - Suffix**: Hide prefix, show identifying suffix

```sapl
policy "show_ssn_last_four"
permit action.id == "verify_identity"
where
    subject.role == "call_center_agent";
transform
    resource.ssn |- filter.blacken(0, 4, "X")
// "123-45-6789" becomes "XXXXXXX6789"
// Useful for: SSN last-four, card numbers, phone numbers
```

**Partial Disclosure - Both Ends**: Reveal prefix and suffix, hide middle

```sapl
policy "partial_email_disclosure"
permit action.id == "view_contact_info"
where
    subject.role == "customer_service";
transform
    resource |- {
        @.email : filter.blacken(3, 12, "*")
    }
// "john.doe@company.com" becomes "joh*****@company.com"
// Useful for: email addresses, names, identifiers
```

### Privacy Protection Through Length Normalization

A critical security concern in data redaction is information leakage through length.
Without protection, attackers can infer sensitive information from the number of
redaction characters:

**Problem - Length Reveals Information**:
```sapl
policy "bad_name_redaction"
permit action.id == "list_users"
where
    subject.role == "guest";
transform
    resource |- {
        @..name : filter.blacken
    }
// "John" becomes "XXXX" (4 characters)
// "Elizabeth" becomes "XXXXXXXXX" (9 characters)
// Attacker knows: second name is longer, can narrow guesses
```

**Solution - Fixed-Length Redaction**:

Using filter operator:
```sapl
policy "good_name_redaction"
permit action.id == "list_users"
where
    subject.role == "guest";
transform
    resource |- {
        @..name : filter.blacken(0, 0, "X", 10)
    }
// "John" becomes "XXXXXXXXXX"
// "Elizabeth" becomes "XXXXXXXXXX"
// Attacker learns nothing from length
```

Using direct function call:
```sapl
policy "normalize_patient_names"
permit action.id == "view_patient_list"
where
    subject.role == "nurse";
transform
    { "patientName" : filter.blacken(resource.patientName, 0, 0, "â–ˆ", 15) }
```

**Use Cases for Length Override**:

User privacy - Hide name lengths in user lists:
```sapl
policy "user_directory_privacy"
permit action.id == "search_directory"
where
    subject.authenticated == true;
transform
    resource.users |- {
        @..firstName : filter.blacken(2, 0, "*", 8),
        @..lastName  : filter.blacken(2, 0, "*", 10)
    }
```

### Data Substitution

The replace function substitutes values while preserving structure:

Using filter operator:
```sapl
policy "sanitize_salary_data"
permit action.id == "view_employee_details"
where
    subject.role != "hr_manager";
transform
    resource |- {
        @.salary : filter.replace(null),
        @.bonus  : filter.replace(0),
        @.notes  : filter.replace("REDACTED")
    }
```

Replace with type-specific defaults:
```sapl
policy "default_values_for_restricted_data"
permit action.id == "api_access"
where
    subject.tier == "basic";
transform
    resource |- {
        @.premiumFeatureEnabled : filter.replace(false),
        @.apiCallLimit          : filter.replace(100),
        @.supportLevel          : filter.replace("standard")
    }
```

### Data Removal

The remove function eliminates data elements entirely:

Using filter operator:
```sapl
policy "remove_payment_details"
permit action.id == "view_order"
where
    subject.role == "warehouse_staff";
transform
    resource |- {
        @.creditCardNumber : filter.remove,
        @.cvv              : filter.remove,
        @.billingAddress   : filter.remove
    }
```

**Applications**:
- Delete fields users should not see
- Remove sensitive array elements
- Clean data before disclosure
- Implement least-privilege data access

## Compliance and Regulatory Requirements

These functions help satisfy regulatory requirements:

- **GDPR**: Minimize data disclosure, implement data minimization
- **HIPAA**: Protect PHI while allowing necessary information access
- **PCI DSS**: Mask payment card numbers per requirements
- **SOX**: Control access to financial data
- **Classification-based access**: Redact classified portions of documents

## Best Practices

### Choosing Between Whitelisting and Blacklisting

**Whitelisting (Object Templates)**: Explicitly construct responses from selected data elements.
This is the more conservative approach as you define exactly what data is shared. If protected
services evolve and add new confidential fields, whitelisting prevents accidental exposure since
new fields are not included in templates by default.

**Blacklisting (Filter Operator)**: Remove or redact specific confidential fields from the resource.
This approach is more flexible for system evolution since adding new shareable fields does not
require policy updates. However, it carries the risk of accidentally exposing new confidential data
if the underlying data model changes.

Choose whitelisting when security is paramount and data schemas are stable. Choose blacklisting
when flexibility is needed and the risk of schema changes introducing confidential data is managed
through other means.

### Redaction Guidelines

1. **Use length normalization** when the length of redacted content could reveal sensitive information
about the data itself
2. **Prefer removal over replacement** when data should not be present in the response at all, as
removal reduces the response size and eliminates any trace of the field
3. **Use partial disclosure** when users need identifying information (like last four digits of SSN)
but full content would be excessive
4. **Consider information inference attacks**: Even partial data can reveal patterns or enable
correlation attacks when combined with other information
5. **Combine multiple transformations** when implementing defense-in-depth strategies for highly
sensitive data

## Function Parameters

### blacken Function
- `original` (required): Text to redact
- `discloseLeft` (optional, default 0): Characters to keep at start
- `discloseRight` (optional, default 0): Characters to keep at end
- `replacement` (optional, default "X"): Character(s) to use for redaction
- `length` (optional): Override redaction length for privacy protection

### replace Function
- `originalValue` (required): Value to replace (ignored if not error)
- `replacementValue` (required): New value to use

### remove Function
- `value` (required): Value to remove (any type)

## Integration with SAPL Policies

These functions integrate with SAPL's transformation operators and can be used in multiple ways.
Generally there are two major approaches:

- **Whitelisting with object templates**: Explicitly construct the resource from exactly the data
to be shared.
- **Blacklisting using the `|-` filter operator**: Remove confidential data from the resource by
blackening/obfuscation, replacement, removal, or arbitrary transformation.

Whitelisting can be considered the more conservative and secure approach, as the policy author knows
a priori exactly which data will be shared. Even if the data schemas of services protected by SAPL
change later and this change introduces new confidential data, using explicit whitelisting prevents
accidental exposure of such new confidential information during overall system evolution.

The filtering solution is more lenient. Here we explicitly specify which information to withhold.
This makes system evolution easier, as policies do not need updates when more data must be shared.
However, it implies the risk of accidental exposure of new confidential data.

Selecting an approach is an important design decision.

### Using the Filter Operator (`|-`) for Blacklisting

The filter operator applies transformations to matched paths:

```sapl
policy "multi_field_redaction"
permit action.id == "view_customer_record"
where
    subject.role == "sales_rep";
transform
    resource |- {
        @.ssn           : filter.blacken(0, 4),
        @.creditScore   : filter.replace(null),
        @.internalNotes : filter.remove
    }
```

**Note**: In filter expressions, the first argument for the value to be transformed is omitted
from the function call. This is syntactic sugar to make filters more readable and concise.

### Templating with Direct Calls to Filter Functions

Functions can be called directly within object templates:

```sapl
policy "prepare_external_report"
permit action.id == "generate_external_report"
where
    subject.organization == "partner_company";
transform
    {
        "contactEmail"  : filter.blacken(resource.contactEmail, 2, 10, "*"),
        "phone"         : filter.blacken(resource.phone, 3, 0, "X", 7),
        "actualRevenue" : filter.replace(resource.actualRevenue, "UNDISCLOSED")
        // As this is whitelisting, only data to be shared is included in this template
        // explicitly. For example, if resource contains profitMargin, it is simply not
        // listed here, and other fields are explicitly whitelisted.
    }
```

### Recursive Path Expressions

Apply transformations to all matching elements at any depth:

```sapl
policy "sanitize_entire_hierarchy"
permit action.id == "export_org_structure"
where
    subject.role == "external_auditor";
transform
    resource |- {
        @..ssn              : filter.blacken(0, 4),
        @..salary           : filter.replace(null),
        @..personalEmail    : filter.blacken(2, 8, "*"),
        @..emergencyContact : filter.remove
    }
```

### Array Filtering with Predicates

Selectively remove or transform array elements:

```sapl
policy "filter_transaction_array"
permit action.id == "view_account_transactions"
where
    subject.accountOwner == false;
transform
    resource.transactions |- {
        @[?(@.type == "internal")]               : filter.remove,
        @[?(@.amount > 10000)].counterparty      : filter.blacken(0, 0, "X", 10),
        @[?(@.category == "sensitive")].memo     : filter.replace("REDACTED")
    }
```

### Integration Best Practices

1. **Use the filter operator for blacklisting**: Apply when redacting specific fields from
existing resource structures
2. **Use object templates for whitelisting**: Apply when explicitly constructing responses
from selected data elements
3. **Combine with path expressions for precision**: Target exact fields or use recursive
patterns for nested structures
4. **Apply conditionally based on subject attributes**: Use different policies for different
user roles to implement role-based data access
5. **Use array predicates for selective filtering**: Filter or transform specific array
elements based on their properties

## filter.replace(original, replacement)

```replace(originalValue, replacementValue)```:
The function will map the ```originalValue``` to the replacement value.
If the original value is an error, it will not be replaced and it bubbles up the evaluation chain.
If the original value is ```undefined``` it will be replaced with the ```replacementValue```.

**Example:**

Given a subscription:
```json
{
  "resource" : {
                 "array" : [ null, true ],
                 "key1"  : "abcde"
               }
}
```

And the policy:
```sapl
policy "test"
permit
transform resource |- {
                        @.array[1] : filter.replace("***"),
                        @.key1     : filter.replace(null)
                      }
```

The decision will contain a ```resource``` as follows:
```json
{
  "array" : [ null, "***" ],
  "key1"  : null
}
```

## filter.blacken(parameters...)

```blacken(TEXT original[, INTEGER>=0 discloseLeft][, INTEGER>=0 discloseRight][, TEXT replacement][, INTEGER>=0 length])```:
This function can be used to partially blacken text in data.
The function requires that ```discloseLeft```, ```discloseRight```, and ```length``` are integers >= 0.
Also, ```original``` and ```replacement``` must be text strings.
The function replaces each character in ```original``` with ```replacement```, while leaving ```discloseLeft```
characters from the beginning and ```discloseRight``` characters from the end unchanged.

If ```length``` is provided, the number of characters replaced is set to ```length```, for example, to
ensure that string length does not leak any information.
If ```length``` is not provided, it will replace all characters that are not disclosed.

When ```discloseLeft``` + ```discloseRight``` >= length of ```original```, the original string is returned unchanged.

Except for ```original```, all parameters are optional.

**Defaults**:

```discloseLeft``` defaults to ```0```, ```discloseRight``` defaults to ```0```
and ```replacement``` defaults to ```"X"```.
The function returns the modified ```original```.

**Example:**

Given a subscription:
```json
{
  "resource" : {
                 "array" : [ null, true ],
                 "key1"  : "abcde"
               }
}
```

And the policy:
```sapl
policy "test"
permit
transform resource |- {
                        @.key1 : filter.blacken(1)
                      }
```

The decision will contain a ```resource``` as follows:
```json
{
  "array" : [ null, true ],
  "key1"  : "aXXXX"
}
```


---

## filter.remove(original)

```remove(value)```: This function maps any ```value``` to ```undefined```.
In filters, ```undefined``` elements of arrays and objects will be silently removed.

**Example:**

The expression ```[ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ] |- { @[-2:] : filter.remove }``` results in ```[0, 1, 2, 3]```.

Given a subscription:
```json
{
  "resource" : {
                 "array" : [ null, true ],
                 "key1"  : "abcde"
               }
}
```

And the policy:
```sapl
policy "test"
permit
transform resource |- {
                        @.key1 : filter.remove
                      }
```

The decision will contain a ```resource``` as follows:
```json
{
  "array" : [ null, true ]
}
```
